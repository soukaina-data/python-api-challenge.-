In this project  I created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I used  a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.
I built a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude.

After all the analysis I demonstrated that the closer we will get to the equator, the hotter it gets the temperature, at least that the initial hypothesis.
